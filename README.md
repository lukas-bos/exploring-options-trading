# Exploration of Options and Trading Strategies

## Introduction
This project encompasses my personal journey, learning about options and trading strategies. The goal of this project is to develop some of the skills necessary for a career in quantitative finance, and to explore the world of options trading. Some of the topics I will be learning to achieve this goal are:

1. Black-Scholes model
2. Greeks
3. Implied volatility
4. Basics of Options (payoffs, strategies, etc.)
5. Trading strategies

The final product of this exploration will be an algorithmic trading strategy that will be tested on historical data, and potentially implemented in a live trading environment.
